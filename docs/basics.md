# Translation Unit

It refers to the most basic unit of compilation which is a *preprocessed* source file (usually named `.cpp`). After preprocessing, the translation unit contains all the included headers, and code generated by the preprocessor directives such as `#if` and `#ifdef`.   

Example: `main.cpp`

```C++
#include <iostream>

#if 1
char globalvar{};
#endif

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

After preprocessing, the translation unit will look like:
```C++
... contents for iostream header ...

char globalvar{};

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

The preprocessor will include the header files (via `#include`) in a *verbatim* manner, that is, substitute the `#include` directives with the exact contents of the header files.

# One Definition Rule (ODR)

The rule ensures that every entity (classes, structs, functions and variables) must have exactly one definition across all translation units, otherwise bad things might happen. This rule is closely related to the [`inline`](./keywords/inline.md) and [`static`](./keywords/static.md) keywords.
